\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

Expand on the background work if necessary to adequately describe the
problem.

\subsection{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Discuss the work related to your project -- include both visualization and
domain-specific references to the problem you're trying to solve.

For example, if my work has to do with Perfopticon~\cite{Moritz:2015:EuroVis}
or comparing request flows~\cite{Sambasivan:2013:InfoVis}, I would want to
cite them. ACM Digital Library makes it easy to get bib files for
proposal.bib and there are guides online for citing
books~\cite{ware:2004:IVP}, theses~\cite{levoy:1989:DSV}, journal
articles~\cite{Lorensen:1987:MCA}, and conference
proceedings~\cite{Nielson:1991:TAD}.
