Although this is not a pioneering work, we think it does add to an academic advisor's arsenal for it considers grades more significantly than state-of-the-art fellows.

We believe our main contribution is that this tool not only gives clustering of courses, but tells why two courses are clustered together in the parallel coordinates diagram. Existing course recommender system based on decision tree or neural network may not persuade users in a straight forward way how the conclusion is made. We use a simple yet convincing heurisitic.

We use parallel coordinates to show the trend in students' grades to indicate coursework content. This may inspire other researchers to study item similarity with this diagram.
