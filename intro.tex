% Introduction and/or Motivation

The real world scene is that coursework contents can be related, making one course as the prerequisite of the other will help students better learn knowledge and obtain better grades. Academic advisor, for example, deals with these issues a lot.
While some course dependency have already been explicitly annotated in practice, more remain unclear and potential. We'd like to design a visualization view to group related courses in clusters based on student enrollment history, and another view to show correlations between the discrete grades of student enrolled in two related courses.

The aims of this research are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item provide a tool to visualize coursework contents similarity based on student membership.
  \item study ordering of neighbours in the node-link diagram to highlight interesting neighbours. 
  \item study representation of correlations between students' grades in two classes.
\end{itemize}
